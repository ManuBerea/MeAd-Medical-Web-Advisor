Obesity is a condition where excess body fat can affect health. It is often assessed using measures like Body Mass Index (BMI), but health risk can also depend on fat distribution and other factors.

Obesity can increase the risk of problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep apnea, and joint pain.

Support may include changes to diet and activity, behavioral strategies, and sometimes medication or surgery in selected cases, usually together with medical guidance.
