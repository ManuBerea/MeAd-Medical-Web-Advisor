Seasonal allergic rhinitis (often called “hay fever”) is an allergic reaction to airborne allergens, most commonly pollen. It tends to appear at certain times of the year. Typical symptoms include sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes. Some people also feel tired or have trouble sleeping due to nasal blockage. Treatment often includes antihistamines, nasal sprays (such as steroid sprays), and reducing exposure to allergens (for example, keeping windows closed during high pollen days).
