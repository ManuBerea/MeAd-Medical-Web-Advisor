Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition where the body does not use insulin effectively, causing higher blood sugar levels over time.

Common signs can include increased thirst, frequent urination, tiredness, blurred vision, and slow-healing wounds. Some people may have no obvious symptoms at first.

Management usually focuses on healthy eating, regular physical activity, weight management, and sometimes medication. Regular monitoring and check-ups help reduce the risk of complications.
