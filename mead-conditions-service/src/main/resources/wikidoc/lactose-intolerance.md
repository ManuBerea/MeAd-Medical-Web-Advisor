Lactose intolerance happens when the body has difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. This is usually due to low levels of an enzyme called lactase.

Symptoms often appear after consuming dairy and may include bloating, abdominal pain, gas, and diarrhea. The amount of lactose that triggers symptoms varies from person to person.

Many people can manage it by limiting lactose, choosing lactose-free products, or using lactase enzyme tablets, while still getting calcium and vitamin D from other sources.
