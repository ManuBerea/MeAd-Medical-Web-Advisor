Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways can become inflamed and narrow, making it harder to breathe. Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Triggers can include exercise, cold air, smoke, dust, and allergies. Asthma is usually managed with inhalers (reliever and preventer medicines) and by avoiding triggers when possible.
